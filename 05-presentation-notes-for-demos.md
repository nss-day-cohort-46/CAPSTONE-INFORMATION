# Presentation Notes for Front-End Capstones

1. On April 6th, demos will start at 9:00 AM.

1. Please remember that this entire presentation should only take 5 minutes on real demo day, including your demo of features -- for this reason, if you have a lot of features, you will need to plan exactly what path you’ll take and in many cases which features you will and won’t show.

1. You should have your user already logged in and ready to go; don’t waste time showing a register/login sequence on real demo day. If you have an awesome landing page that you want to demo, logout after you are demoing your app so you end on that page.

1. At some point before the end of Monday April 5th, make sure to test out any audio or video that will be a part of your presentation to see if it comes through when you are sharing your screen.

1. You will only be showing the product, not the code. Do not have your developer tools visible while you are demoing your application.

1. Remember to turn off notifications when you are sharing your screen to demo.

1. A slideshow is required for actual demo day.

1. There will be no Q&A period on demo day.

1. Slideshow should include:
- The name of your app
- A description of your app
- The objectives of your app (What does it do? Who is it for? What is the problem you are solving?)
- An actual demo of your app -- you can have a slide with just a link for this if you like
- Tech stack list (optional -- but if you do include it, do not read this list, and only mention aloud anything you used that was not JavaScript, React, React-Router-Dom, Context API; basically don’t spend time talking about stuff everyone else also has in their project or has used extensively, but if you had a noteworthy experience with some other external library or module, it may be worth mentioning)
- Lessons Learned
