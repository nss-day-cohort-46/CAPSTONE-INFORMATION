This repo contains the information you need about capstones - due dates, expectations, etc. Click on one of the links below to find out more.

### Requirements & Expectations

You will get approximately two weeks to build an application that showcases what you have learned about front end development during the last three months at NSS. You must have a capstone approved by your lead instructor in order to move on to the back end. The application you build must meet the following [expectations](./01-requirements-and-deadlines.md).

### DEADLINES
* **Monday 03/08/2021 9:00 AM:** Initial Proposal Due, see [instructions](./02-initial-capstone-proposals.md). **Only after you have approval on your initial proposal, should you start working on the rest of your capstone proposal!**

* **Monday 03/15/2021:** Final Capstone Proposal Due, see [instructions](./03-mentor-one-on-ones.md). - please don't wait until the actual due date for this. We have to review all proposals and have one on ones with each of you before approving the proposals. This will be done on a first come, first serve basis.

* **Monday 03/15/2021 & Tuesday 03/16/2021:** 1-on-1s with mentor to determine MVP in the order the completed proposals were submitted. **Once you have approval from your capstone mentor, you may begin coding!**

* **Thursday 03/25/2021:** That last day for MVP approval - If you reach MVP earlier, please reach out to your mentor. For MVP approval, you must walk your mentor through your application. Once they agree that you have implemented all the features for MVP, your lead instructor will then sit with you and ask you to explain the code for your application. They could also ask you questions about what we have learned in the last three months. **Only after approval from the lead instructor on your MVP may you move on to stretch goals!**

* **Friday 03/26/2021:** Soft demos start at 9 AM. EVERY person will do a soft demo in front of the cohort. See [expectations for demos](./05-presentation-notes-for-demos.md).

* **Monday 04/12/2021:** Preparation for Capstone Demos - also your last day of front-end.

* **Tuesday 04/13/2021:** Front-end Capstone Demos for NSS students & staff. See [expectations for demos](./05-presentation-notes-for-demos.md).
